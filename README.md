Core principles, patterns and best practices for building a react native application

## Tech Stack

### Application Blueprint

* Always up-to-date [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) scaffolding
* Modular and well-documented structure for application code
* [Expo](https://expo.io/) Easy to build a React Native app without any build configuration
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for safe and reasonable state management
* Painless React forms with [formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik)
* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) for awesome navigation with 60fps transitions

* :star: Multi-environment configuration (dev, staging, production,...) for iOS and Android
* :star: Built-in error handling, loading, updating and customizable screens

### Testing Setup

* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit testing application code and providing coverage information
* [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and fully mocked React Native for unit testing UI components

### Dev tools
